# AI for the Arts and Humanities Portfolio
This respiratory is for the AI for the arts and humanities course. 

The purpose of a respiratory is to act as a folder to save realted items for the project that a user is working on. 

My List of goals for this repository are:
- To Learn GitHub basics

- To learn how AI programs operate
