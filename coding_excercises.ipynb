    "1. Variables\n",
    "• Initial Prompt: Could you suggest a modification of the Python code for “Hello, world!” to demonstrate the concept of variables to a complete beginner in programming? Please explain the code step-by-step highlighting any key aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely! Let's modify the classic **\"Hello, world!\"** Python program to introduce the concept of **variables**, which are used to store data that your program can use and manipulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Original Code (Basic)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This simply prints the message directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠 Modified Code with a Variable\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "print(message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **`message = \"Hello, world!\"`**\n",
    "- This line creates a **variable** called `message`.\n",
    "- The **equals sign (`=`)** is used to **assign** a value to the variable.\n",
    "- `\"Hello, world!\"` is a **string** (text) that is stored in the variable.\n",
    "- Now, instead of writing the message directly in `print()`, we store it in a variable first.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`print(message)`**\n",
    "- This line tells Python to **print the value** stored in the variable `message`.\n",
    "- It will output:  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Hello, world!\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft prompted: Would you like to explore how variables work with numbers or user input next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Key learning outcomes:\n",
    "• Variables are useful for reusability, readability, and flexibility. \n",
    "• They help the user to store information for later use. \n",
    "• They are helpful for easily chanfing values without rewriting the code miltiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Functions\n",
    "• Initial Prompt: Could you suggest a modification of the Python code for “Hello, world!” to demonstrate the concept of functions to a complete beginner in\n",
    "programming? Please explain the code step-by-step highlighting any key\n",
    "aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely! Let's take the classic **\"Hello, world!\"** program and modify it to introduce the concept of **functions** in Python, which are a fundamental building block in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Original Code (Basic)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This simply prints the message to the screen. Now let’s enhance it using a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠 Modified Code with a Function\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **`def greet():`**\n",
    "- `def` is short for **define**. It tells Python you're creating a **function**.\n",
    "- `greet` is the **name** of the function. You can name it anything (following naming rules).\n",
    "- The parentheses `()` are used to define **parameters** (inputs). In this case, there are none.\n",
    "- The colon `:` indicates the start of the function **body** (the code that runs when the function is called).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Indented Code Block**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This line is **inside** the function. It’s indented to show it belongs to `greet()`.\n",
    "- It will only run when the function is **called**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Calling the Function**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greet()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This line **calls** or **executes** the function.\n",
    "- Without this line, nothing would happen — defining a function doesn’t run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft prompted: Would you like to see how to add parameters to the function next, or maybe how to return values from a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Learning Outcomes: \n",
    "• Functions are useful for oragnising code.\n",
    "• They help to reuse code wihtout rewriting it. \n",
    "• They also help to make programs more modular and aid readability. "
