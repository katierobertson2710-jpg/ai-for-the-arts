    "\n",
    "Key Learning Outcomes: From submitting this prompt to copilot I have learned that arrays are designed to store elements of the same type efficiently, similar to lists. They use loops to process elements and they are more memory-efficient that lists for larger datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.\tExtending Functionality \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 8.\tIf/Else/ElIf Statements \n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Prompt: Could you suggest a modification of the Python code for “Hello, world!” to demonstrate the concepts of if, elif, and else statements to a complete beginner in programming? Please explain the code step-by-step highlighting any key aspects.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suggested Prompts: “Show how to convert numbers to strings.”, “Explain operator precedence.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Learning Outcomes: From submitting this prompt to copilot I have learned that operators are symbols/keywords within Python that perform operations depending on the data type. \n",

    "### Reflection on the benefits and limitations of using Copilot for learning Python: \n",
    "After submitting and reviewing the above series of prompts into Copilot for the purpose of learning how to code in the Python language, I have learned of both the benefits and limitations that Copilot has that impact me achieving this goal. On the plus side, Copilot is excellent as it provides immediate examples of code that I can implement straight into my Codespace which helps me save time. It provided me with suggestive prompts that allowed me to learn even more about the concepts I was reviewing, as well as providing detailed step-by-step instructions that make it simple for a beginner like myself to follow. However, much like with all AI tools, Copilot can lack the ability to teach or articulate coding concepts the same way that a real teacher can, it cannot alter its teaching style in response to a student’s understanding. In the same vain, using an AI tool to learn code promotes a reliance on the ability to just copy and paste code over without actually engaging with the logic behind it. \n",
